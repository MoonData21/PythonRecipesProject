# PythonRecipesProject

My Food Recipe Projects App: https://moonsrecipeapp-20e62da05e68.herokuapp.com/
Description: This is a Django project that registers a user and allows the users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD operations) food recipes.

Only images of some of the code components have been provided.

The project was completed from a Django project playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7EJu9Gd5Ns.

However, I added pagination and a search recipes option to the original Django project as well.
