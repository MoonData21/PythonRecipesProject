# PythonRecipesProject

My Food Recipe Projects App: https://anoon14.pythonanywhere.com/
Description: This is a Django project that registers a user and allows the users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD operations) food recipes. I originally had this deployed to Heroku, but it was too expensive so I changed to pythonanywhere.com for the deployment. This site looks less expensive and will let me add more recipes without charging me so much money.

The project was completed from a Django food recipes project playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7EJu9Gd5Ns.

I used the following Youtube videos to get the pythonanywhere.com deployment to work using a virtual environment.

However, I added pagination and a search recipes option to the original Django project as well.
